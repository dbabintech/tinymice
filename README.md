Tinymice is a simple auto clicker for linux that support profiles.
I don't have any plan to support a windows version but if you remove codebotctrls from the dependency, 
it can also be compiled for windows.
This software need Sqlite. To avoid libsqlite3.so error, you need to install libsqlite3-dev.

Ubuntu users:
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev


Linux dependency(tested with Linux Mint XFCE 19.3)
To compile
  Lazarus 2.0.6
  FPC 3.0.4
  libxtst-dev
  libgl-dev 
  
To Execute
  libsqlite3-dev
